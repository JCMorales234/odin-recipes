        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          Ajiaco is a thick, creamy soup from BogotÃ¡ and the surrounding
          Cundinamarca region. Its unique texture comes from a mix of three
          types of potatoes (creole, pastusa, and sabanera), which all cook down
          differently. The soup is made with chicken, corn on the cob, and a
          special herb called guascas, which gives it its distinct flavor. It's
          traditionally served with a side of cream, capers, and a slice of
          avocado. This is a complete and comforting meal, perfect for a cold
          day.

        <h2>Ingredients (for 4 people)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 boneless chicken breasts.</li>
          <li>3 ears of corn, cut into pieces.</li>
          <li>
            3 types of potatoes (about 2.2 lbs total): criolla (this type will
            dissolve and thicken the soup), pastusa and sabanera (these will
            stay firm).
          </li>
          <li>
            1 bunch of guascas (a key herb, often found in Latin American
            grocery stores).
          </li>
          <li>1 green onion and 1 bunch of cilantro.</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
          <li>To serve: heavy cream, capers, and avocado.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large pot, place the chicken breasts, corn, green onion, and
            cilantro. Cover with water, season with salt and pepper, and cook
            until the chicken is tender (about 30-40 minutes).
          </li>
          <li>
            While the chicken cooks, peel and slice all the potatoes. The
            criolla potatoes are the most important for thickening the soup.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the chicken and corn from the pot. Shred the chicken and set
            it aside. Add all the sliced potatoes and the guascas to the
            remaining broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the soup simmer on medium-low heat. The criolla potatoes will
            break down, giving the ajiaco its creamy texture. This should take
            about 20-30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the shredded chicken and corn back into the pot. Serve the soup
            in deep bowls, and garnish each one with a dollop of heavy cream, a
            spoonful of capers, and a slice of avocado.
          </li>
