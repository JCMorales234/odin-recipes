        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
          Patacones are fried green plantain patties that are a popular side
          dish or snack across Colombia. They are crispy on the outside and
          tender on the inside. When served with hogao (a traditional Colombian
          tomato and onion sauce) and grated cheese, they become a delicious and
          satisfying appetizer or light meal. This is a simple but incredibly
          flavorful dish.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Peel the green plantains and cut them into thick slices (about 1-2
            inches).
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a generous amount of oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.
            Fry the plantain slices until they are soft and a light yellow color
            (about 2-3 minutes per side). Do not let them get too brown or
            crispy yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the plantains from the oil and, using a plate, a wooden
            board, or a special tool called a tostonera, smash each piece into a
            flat, round patty.
          </li>
          <li>
            Put the flattened plantain patties back into the hot oil. This time,
            fry them until they are golden brown and very crispy (about 2
            minutes per side). Remove and drain on a paper towel. Season with
            salt immediately.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the patacones are frying, finely chop the tomato and onion.
            SautÃ© them in a small pan with a little oil until they form a soft
            sauce. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cumin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the hot, crispy patacones on a plate. Top them with a spoonful
            of the warm hogao and a generous sprinkle of grated cheese. Serve
            immediately.
          </li>
